  ]
  In accordance with the APA Publication Manual (7th ed.) recommendations on transparency, I disclose that artificial intelligence (AI) tools were used in limited ways during the preparation of this dissertation. Specifically, OpenAI’s ChatGPT (GPT-5.2 model) were employed to assist with language refinement, code suggestions and debugging in R and Python, and the generation of images to illustrate certain ideas of this thesis' Introduction. These tools were used under the author’s supervision to enhance clarity and efficiency. The AI systems were not used to generate, analyze, or interpret research data, nor did they contribute to the formulation of hypotheses, theoretical arguments, or conclusions. All intellectual and analytic content is solely the work of the author.
